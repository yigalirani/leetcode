1. simple reqursive binary tree - see the count leafs
2. complex reqursive binary tree - reqursion retuns two diffrent values: 124
3. cache variables in a hash - like in two sum
4. two heads in array  26
5. detirmenstic parse - 717
6. reqursive parse by passing cur token pos and returning tree+result token_pos: 1028
7. append_token function than gets called from innter loop and also at the end: 1018
8. collect in array and then sort - 530
9 array of aacumlative sum. can also be acumlative min/max - 689
10 to know if a robot performing instructing islimited to a cicle, execute the instructinos 4 times and see if return to base.1041 
11. in some cases, when doing reqursive binary tree, you have to ask asking if both children are none - 1022 
12. do do array paritiionig, do the simple alg like in 813, 132
13 to catch tyos quickly, uses short experssion and partision complex expreion to assigned variables. for exampl: 
   before: ans=max(ans,avg(start,i)+f(start+1,k-1))
   after:  a=avg(start,i)
           b=f(start+1,k-1)//the error stands out now, it should be b=f(i,k-1)/
           ans=max(ans,a+b)
14 dynamic progammic using array. for example https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-refueling-stops/
